# 👩🏽‍💻 Chioma Williams' Ecosystemized Journal & Portfolio

Welcome to my **ecosystemized journal** — a curated and structured repository of everything I’m exploring as I transition into the world of tech from a non-technical background.  

This is more than just notes. It’s a living, evolving **documentation system**, showcasing how I apply concepts, tools, and best practices in real-time.

## 🧠 Why This Journal?

> “You don’t truly understand something until you can explain it simply.”  
> — Albert Einstein

This repository is my attempt to:
- Reinforce my learning through active documentation
- Build a professional habit of technical writing
- Share insights and discoveries with others learning in public
- Showcase growth and readiness for opportunities in Buisness Analysis, Process Automation, IT Support, CRM Setup & Administration, and Data Operations
